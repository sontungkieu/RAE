# Documentation

This folder is the detailed documentation entrypoint for the XLA branch of RAE
and the lightweight JAX/NNX adapter shipped in `src_jax/`.

## Documents

- [Architecture](./architecture.md): system overview, module boundaries, and code map.
- [Workflows](./workflows.md): practical runbooks for setup, Stage 2 training, sampling, FID, wandb, and Hugging Face upload.
- [Config Reference](./config-reference.md): YAML schema and which scripts consume each block.
- [PDF Manual](../pdf/main.pdf): detailed Vietnamese PDF for architecture, workflows, config, and operations.
- [Kaggle Notebook (moe1)](../raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-moe1.ipynb): end-to-end CelebA notebook for the JAX `RAE + SiTDH-S + moe1` flow, including the offline `GMM + CNN-MoE` source build step.
- [Kaggle TPU Notebook (SiTDH-B moe1)](../raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1.ipynb): sibling `TPU v5e-8` notebook for the DH/two-tower `SiTDH-B + moe1` setup, keeping the same Kaggle/JAX flow but adding the offline GMM artifact and learned source prior.
- [Kaggle TPU Notebook (SiTDH-B moe1 Resume)](../raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1-resume.ipynb): minimal `TPU v5e-8` resume-only notebook for the `SiTDH-B + moe1` runs, checking both the restored Orbax workdir and the persisted `celeba256_source_gmm.npz` artifact.

## Recommended Reading Order

1. Read [Architecture](./architecture.md) to understand the Stage 1 and Stage 2 split.
2. Read [Workflows](./workflows.md) before running experiments.
3. Use [Config Reference](./config-reference.md) while editing YAML files.

## Branch Scope

This branch is centered on two runtime paths:

- `src/`: the existing `torch_xla` TPU path for Stage 2 training, Stage 2 sampling, Stage 1 reconstruction, and host-side FID utilities
- `src_jax/`: a thin JAX/NNX adapter that keeps the current YAML schema, logs to wandb, can upload workdirs to Hugging Face, and supports Stage 2 train/sample plus Stage 1 reconstruction, folder reconstruction, and latent-stat building without forking the whole codebase

Limitations:

- `src/` still does not ship a dedicated Stage 1 training entrypoint on the XLA side.
- `src_jax/` intentionally does not port the full adversarial Stage 1 training loop yet.
