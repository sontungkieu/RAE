We present Representation Autoencoders (RAE), a class of autoencoders that utilize  pretrained, frozen representation encoders such as [DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07193) and [SigLIP2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14786) as encoders with trained ViT decoders. RAE can be used in a two-stage training pipeline for high-fidelity image synthesis, where a Stage 2 diffusion model is trained on the latent space of a pretrained RAE to generate images.

This branch contains:

TorchXLA/TPU:
* A TPU implementation of RAE and pretrained weights.
* Sampling of RAE and SiT<sup>DH</sup> on TPU.

JAX/NNX:
* A lightweight JAX/NNX compatibility layer under `src_jax/`.
* Stage 2 train/sample entrypoints that reuse the existing YAML schema.
* Weights & Biases logging, Hugging Face upload, and optional FID scoring without duplicating the full PyTorch codebase.

## Environment

### Dependency Setup
1. Create environment and install via `uv`:
   ```bash
   conda create -n rae python=3.10 -y
   conda activate rae
   pip install uv
   
   # Install PyTorch 2.2.0 with CUDA 12.1
   uv pip install torch~=2.5.0 torch_xla[tpu]~=2.5.0 torchvision==0.20.1 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/libtpu-releases/index.html
   
   # Install other dependencies
   uv pip install timm==0.9.16 accelerate==0.23.0 torchdiffeq==0.2.5 wandb scipy torch-fidelity
   uv pip install "numpy<2" "transformers==4.57.1" einops
   ```

2. If you want to use the JAX/NNX adapter in `src_jax/`, also install:
   ```bash
   uv pip install "jax[cuda12]==0.5.1" flax==0.10.4 optax==0.2.4 orbax-checkpoint==0.11.16
   uv pip install ml-collections clu absl-py etils datasets huggingface_hub tensorflow-datasets
   ```

   Notes:
   - On TPU, replace `jax[cuda12]` with the TPU wheel flow you already use in your environment.
   - If Kaggle TPU rejects `jaxlib/xla_extension.so` with `cannot enable executable stack`, run `uv run python scripts/clear_elf_execstack.py --package jaxlib` once inside the same environment.
   - The JAX Kaggle notebooks now set `UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=/tmp/.venv`, `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache`, and use `uv sync -q` against the repo `pyproject.toml` before running the package-backed cells.
   - This repo patches the pinned `diffuse_nnx` checkout to import Dinov2 models from `transformers` subpackages, and the supported version for that path is `transformers==4.57.1`.
   - The same backend patch also lazy-loads `google-cloud-storage`, so the RAE/DINO Stage-1 path does not need that package unless you actually use backend components that fetch assets from GCS.
   - The backend bootstrap patch also fixes `diffuse_nnx` EMA initialization so the EMA starts from a copy of the current model instead of an all-zero parameter tree. Old Orbax checkpoints keep the EMA state they already saved, so start a fresh run if you need the corrected EMA trajectory.
   - The JAX adapter derives the Stage-1 latent `downsample_factor` and `latent_channels` from `misc.latent_size`, so backend preview sampling and FID operate at latent resolution instead of accidentally allocating image-resolution latent noise.
   - `src_jax/` pins `diffuse_nnx` at commit `023afd23c7b62a8cdb00e840b36a4ab8fc970bba` and bootstraps it into `~/.cache/rae_jax/diffuse_nnx` on first run.

## Data & Model Preparation

### Download Pre-trained Models

The upstream asset collection still contains the original RAE decoders, legacy DiT<sup>DH</sup> checkpoints, and latent-normalization stats. This branch switches the default Stage 2 configs to SiT<sup>DH</sup>, so sampling configs expect you to attach fresh SiTDH-compatible checkpoints before use. To download the shared assets:


```bash

cd RAE
pip install huggingface_hub
hf download nyu-visionx/RAE-collections \
  --local-dir models 
```


To download specific models, run:
```bash
hf download nyu-visionx/RAE-collections \
  <remote_model_path> \
  --local-dir models 
```

### Prepare Dataset

1. Download ImageNet-1k.
2. Point Stage 1 and Stage 2 scripts to the training split via `--data-path`.


## Config-based Initialization

All training and sampling entrypoints are driven by OmegaConf YAML files. A
single config describes the Stage 1 autoencoder, the Stage 2 diffusion model,
and the solver used during training or inference. A minimal example looks like:

```yaml
stage_1:
   target: stage1.RAE
   params: { ... }
   ckpt: <path_to_ckpt>  

stage_2:
   target: stage2.models.SiT.SiTDH
   params: { ... }
   ckpt: <path_to_ckpt>  

transport:
   params:
      path_type: Linear
      prediction: velocity
      ...
sampler:
   mode: ODE
   params:
      num_steps: 50
      ...
guidance:
   method: cfg/autoguidance
   scale: 1.0
   ...
misc:
   latent_size: [768, 16, 16]
   num_classes: 1000
training:
   ...

# Optional online validation during Stage 2 training.
eval:
   ...
```

- `stage_1` instantiates the frozen encoder and trainable decoder. For Stage 1
  training you can point to an existing checkpoint via `stage_1.ckpt` or start
  from `pretrained_decoder_path`.
- `stage_2` defines the diffusion transformer. During sampling you must provide
  `ckpt`; during training you typically omit it so weights initialise randomly.
- `transport`, `sampler`, and `guidance` select the forward/backward SDE/ODE
  integrator and optional classifier-free or autoguidance schedule.
- `misc` collects shapes, class counts, and scaling constants used by both
  stages.
- `training` contains defaults that the training scripts consume (epochs,
  learning rate, EMA decay, gradient accumulation, etc.).
- `eval` is optional. On the XLA path it controls TPU-native validation loss and
  optional host-side FID. On the JAX path it now also drives held-out
  validation loss plus optional online FID.

Stage 1 training configs additionally include a top-level `gan` block that
configures the discriminator architecture and the LPIPS/GAN loss schedule.


### Provided Configs:

#### Stage1

We release decoders for DINOv2-B, SigLIP-B, MAE-B, at `configs/stage1/pretrained/`.

There is also a training script for training a ViT-XL decoder on DINOv2-B: `configs/stage1/training/DINOv2-B_decXL.yaml`

#### Stage2

This branch provides SiTDH config templates for both training and sampling at `configs/stage2/`.
The checked-in sampling configs intentionally leave `stage_2.ckpt` and `guidance.guidance_model.ckpt` as `null` until you point them at SiTDH-compatible weights.

## Stage 1: Representation Autoencoder

### Sampling/Reconstruction

Use `src/stage1_sample.py` to encode/decode a single image:

```bash
python src/stage1_sample.py \
  --config <config> \
  --image assets/pixabay_cat.png \
```

For batched reconstructions and `.npz` export, run the XLA native DDP variant:

```bash
  python src/stage1_sample_ddp.py \
  --config <config> \
  --data-path <imagenet_val_split> \
  --sample-dir recon_samples \
  --image-size 256
```

The script writes per-image PNGs as well as a packed `.npz` suitable for FID.

## Stage 2: Latent Diffusion Transformer


For sampling, XLA branch only supports a manually implemented Euler sampler as `torchdiffeq` is not compatible with TPU.

### Training

Train Stage 2 on TPU with:

```bash
python src/train.py \
  --config configs/stage2/training/ImageNet256/SiTDH-XL_DINOv2-B.yaml \
  --data-path <imagenet_train_split> \
  --results-dir results \
  --image-size 256 \
  --precision bf16
```

To enable Weights & Biases logging, set:

```bash
export ENTITY=<wandb_entity>
export PROJECT=<wandb_project>
export WANDB_KEY=<wandb_api_key>
```

and add `--wandb` to the training command.

On the JAX path, each workdir now persists a `wandb_run.json` binding file.
Fresh workdirs create a fresh W&B run ID and start with `resume="never"`.
Later resumes of the same workdir reuse that exact run ID and automatically
rewind W&B history to the latest `checkpoint_*` step with `resume_from`, so the
run continues from the checkpoint instead of keeping stale post-checkpoint
history such as `120k -> 150k` after a crash. If you resume an older Orbax
workdir that predates `wandb_run.json`, pass `--wandb-run-id <existing_run_id>`
once so the adapter can bind that legacy workdir to the exact historical W&B
run before continuing.

Stage 2 training now logs the following namespaces:

- `train/*`: loss, learning rate, optimizer steps/sec, images/sec, epoch, and gradient norm when clipping is enabled.
- `train/*` on the JAX path can additionally log latent and activation diagnostics when you enable `training.log_rae_latent_stats=true` and `training.log_activation_stats=true`, for example `train_rae_latent_rms`, `train_rae_latent_var`, `train_sitdh_output_rms`, `train_sitdh_output_var`, `train_sitdh_act_enc_00_rms`, and `train_sitdh_act_dec_01_var`.
- `eval/*`: periodic validation loss on a held-out `ImageFolder` split
  (`eval/ema_loss` by default, plus `eval/model_loss` when enabled), together
  with duration/batch counters for each validation pass.
- `checkpoint/*`: checkpoint save step.
- `network_samples`: current online-model preview images logged at the training step.
- `ema_network_samples`: EMA preview images logged at the training step.

To enable online validation loss, add an optional `eval` block to the Stage 2 training config:

```yaml
eval:
  data_path: data/imagenet/val/
  eval_every: 5000
  batch_size: 128        # per TPU core; defaults to the train micro batch size
  num_workers: 4         # defaults to training.num_workers
  max_batches: 32        # optional cap per rank to limit eval cost
  eval_model: false      # set true to also evaluate the non-EMA model
  fid_ref: data/imagenet/VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz
  fid_every: 25000       # defaults to eval_every when omitted
  fid_num_samples: 4096  # trade off speed vs stability (e.g. 1024 / 4096 / 50000)
  fid_per_proc_batch_size: 4
  fid_batch_size: 64     # Inception batch size on the host CPU/GPU
  fid_device: cpu
  fid_num_threads: 96    # optional torch CPU thread count for host-side FID
  fid_label_sampling: equal
  fid_eval_model: false  # set true to also compute FID for the non-EMA model
```

This XLA branch runs validation loss on TPU inside the training loop. Optional FID
evaluation is also available at eval checkpoints by sampling on TPU and computing
Inception features on the host CPU or GPU.

On the JAX path, the default `FID-4K (cfg=...)` series follows the EMA model.
Setting `fid_eval_model: true` adds separate `FID-4K/model (cfg=...)` metrics
for the live online model without changing the default EMA series.

### JAX / NNX Compatibility Layer

This branch also ships a thin adapter in `src_jax/` that keeps the current
OmegaConf YAML files, but runs Stage 2 through a JAX/NNX backend instead of
duplicating the entire PyTorch codebase.

Main entrypoints:

```bash
python3 src_jax/train.py \
  --config configs/stage2/training/ImageNet256/SiTDH-XL_DINOv2-B.yaml \
  --data-path <imagenet_train_root> \
  --results-dir results_jax \
  --precision bf16 \
  --wandb \
  --set training.global_batch_size=256
```

On Kaggle TPU, the standardized notebook defaults on this branch are
`--set training.num_workers=16`, `--set training.prefetch_factor=4`, and
`--set eval.prefetch_factor=4`. This keeps the backend PyTorch loader in the
stable range we ship for the JAX notebooks while still letting the host queue
several ready batches ahead of the TPU. The adapter also disables the backend
TensorBoard summary writer on Kaggle and keeps metric logging on stdout plus
wandb.

When `--wandb` is enabled on `src_jax/train.py`, the adapter also writes a
`wandb_run.json` file inside the selected workdir. That file is now the source
of truth for exact W&B resume behavior on later launches. When checkpoints
exist, later launches now auto-rewind the bound W&B run to the latest
checkpoint step before logging continues. If you point `--workdir` at a legacy
Orbax directory with checkpoints but no `wandb_run.json`, pass
`--wandb-run-id <existing_run_id>` once; otherwise the adapter aborts instead
of creating a fresh W&B run by accident.

```bash
python3 src_jax/sample.py \
  --config configs/stage2/sampling/ImageNet256/SiTDHXL-DINOv2-B_AG.yaml \
  --output sample_jax.png \
  --class-labels 207,360
```

```bash
python3 src_jax/sample_ddp.py \
  --config configs/stage2/sampling/ImageNet256/SiTDHXL-DINOv2-B.yaml \
  --sample-dir samples_jax \
  --num-samples 50000 \
  --label-sampling equal \
  --fid-ref /path/to/reference_stats.npz
```

```bash
python3 src_jax/stage1_sample.py \
  --config configs/stage1/pretrained/DINOv2-B_512.yaml \
  --image assets/pixabay_cat.png \
  --output recon_jax.png
```

```bash
python3 src_jax/build_stage1_stats.py \
  --config configs/stage1/pretrained/DINOv2-B.yaml \
  --input /path/to/train_imagefolder \
  --output /path/to/stage1_stat.pt \
  --set stage_1.params.normalization_stat_path=/path/to/bootstrap_identity_stat.pt
```

```bash
python3 src_jax/reconstruct_folder.py \
  --config configs/stage1/pretrained/DINOv2-B.yaml \
  --input /path/to/val_imagefolder \
  --output-dir recon_jax_dir \
  --batch-size 8
```

```bash
python3 src_jax/push_hf.py \
  --path results_jax/<run_name> \
  --repo-id <hf_user_or_org>/<repo_name>
```

Key behavior:

- `src_jax/` accepts the same top-level YAML blocks: `stage_1`, `stage_2`, `transport`, `sampler`, `guidance`, `misc`, `training`, and `eval`.
- `stage_2.ckpt` can point to a SiTDH-compatible PyTorch `.pt` checkpoint for inference, or to a JAX Orbax directory from a previous SiTDH run for resumed JAX runs.
- `--set key=value` applies OmegaConf CLI overrides without adding a second config format.
- `src_jax/build_stage1_stats.py` writes a PyTorch-compatible `stat.pt` file, so the same Stage 1 normalization stats can be reused by both the original repo code and the JAX adapter.
- the Stage 1-only JAX utilities (`src_jax/stage1_sample.py`, `src_jax/build_stage1_stats.py`, and `src_jax/reconstruct_folder.py`) can run with a YAML that only defines `stage_1`; they do not require `stage_2.target`.
- `src_jax/export_celebahq_hf.py` is now the default CelebA-HQ exporter for Kaggle and local JAX flows: it downloads `eurecom-ds/celeba-hq-256` from Hugging Face into a cache directory and materializes the dataset into the `ImageFolder` layout still expected by the current JAX training pipeline, without requiring TFDS manual tar files.
- `src_jax/export_celebahq_tfds.py` remains available as a fallback for the official TFDS `celeb_a_hq/256` path; it still requires the manual tar files under `--manual-dir`, and it forces the pure-Python protobuf runtime before importing TFDS so Kaggle does not trip over the common descriptor-compatibility crash.
- for dataset-specific Stage 1 stats, start from a bootstrap identity stats file (`mean=0`, `var=1`) and override `stage_1.params.normalization_stat_path` during the stats pass.
- `src_jax/build_source_gmm.py` now defaults to the full flattened RAE latent when fitting the diagonal GMM. On the DH branches that means keeping the full `16 x 16 x 768 -> 196608` feature vector while still using the low-copy builder path: the script preallocates one `N x D` backing matrix, but large `flatten` runs now resolve `--storage-dtype auto` to `float16` so host RAM stays closer to half the old footprint. The offline EM path then upcasts chunks back to `float32` by default via `--compute-dtype auto`; you can still force `float32` storage or `float16` compute explicitly if you want to trade RAM against numerical stability. `--feature-extractor pyramid_16k` remains available when you explicitly want a structured compressed feature, while `spatial_mean` stays the low-RAM fallback.
- `src_jax/moe1/` plus `src_jax/backend_overlay/diffuse_nnx/interfaces/continuous_moe1.py` implement the learned source stack. On this branch the CNN-MoE runs directly on the RAE latent layout `B x 16 x 16 x 768`, so the current default source recipe keeps a wider trunk at `hidden_channels=256` while otherwise following the newer `shortcut-models@moe1` knobs more closely: `condition_dim=16`, `router_temperature=2.0`, `balance_loss_weight=0.1`, `entropy_loss_weight=1.0e-2`, and `var_kl_loss_weight=1.0`. The same path also logs `train_source_logvar_mean` and `train_source_var_mean`.
- `ENTITY` / `PROJECT` / `WANDB_KEY` are bridged to the `WANDB_*` variables expected by the JAX backend.
- `--hf-repo-id` on `src_jax/train.py` uploads the finished workdir directly to Hugging Face.
- `src_jax/build_fid_stats.py` builds backend-native `fid_ref` files with the same Flax Inception detector used by JAX online FID.
- `training.log_rae_latent_stats=true` makes the JAX train loop log RMS and variance of the Stage 1 RAE latents actually consumed by Stage 2, while `training.log_activation_stats=true` logs RMS and variance for the SiTDH output and each encoder/decoder activation block.
- `training.prefetch_factor` and `eval.prefetch_factor` now forward directly into the host-side PyTorch `DataLoader` used by the JAX Stage 2 path, so you can deepen the per-worker prefetch queue without editing the cached backend checkout by hand.
- `training.random_flip` and `eval.random_flip` now control the raw-image transform on the JAX Stage 2 path; CelebA-HQ configs on this branch default training-time horizontal flips on, while eval/FID stays unflipped unless you opt in explicitly.
- `src_jax/train.py` now binds each JAX workdir to a persisted `wandb_run.json`; resume reuses that exact W&B run ID and auto-rewinds the W&B history to the latest Orbax checkpoint step, while legacy workdirs without metadata require a one-time `--wandb-run-id <existing_run_id>`.
- `raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1.ipynb` is the `TPU v5e-8` sibling notebook for the DH/two-tower `SiTDH-B + moe1` recipe, reusing the same Kaggle/JAX flow while writing `CelebA256_SiTDH-B_DINOv2-B_moe1_jax_tpuv5e8.yaml`, setting `hidden_size=[768, 2048]`, `depth=[12, 2]`, and `num_heads=[12, 16]`, and building the GMM artifact before training. This notebook also keeps `src_jax/build_fid_stats.py --num-workers 32` by default.
- `raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1-resume.ipynb` is the resume-only notebook for the `SiTDH-B + moe1` variant: it still restores the archived workdir, checks that `celeba256_source_gmm.npz` is present, resumes the newest `CelebA256_SiTDH-B_DINOv2-B_moe1_jax_tpuv5e8-*` run, and now expects either the persisted `wandb_run.json` binding file or a one-time `--wandb-run-id <existing_run_id>` for legacy workdirs.
- In the shipped CelebA `moe1` TPU notebooks, the final Stage 2 train/resume cells point `--data-path` at `/kaggle/working/celeba256_imgfolder`, keep `eval.data_path` on the `val` split, standardize loader overrides to `training.num_workers=16`, `training.prefetch_factor=4`, and `eval.prefetch_factor=4`, enable `training.log_rae_latent_stats=true` plus `training.log_activation_stats=true`, and set `RAE_JAX_REBUILD_BACKEND=1` so the backend overlay reliably picks up the new `sit_gmm_moe1` interface on fresh Kaggle sessions.
- the shipped TPU notebooks on this branch now also default `export PROJECT="moe-diffusion"`; the existing `run_name` strings already encode the dataset, backbone, `moe1`, and TPU pipeline, so no extra suffix was added to the experiment name.
- `raes-jax-celeba-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1-resume.ipynb` is the resume-only Kaggle TPU notebook for the latest `CelebA256_SiTDH-B_DINOv2-B_moe1_jax_tpuv5e8-*` Orbax workdir, keeps the persisted `celeba256_source_gmm.npz` artifact in place, and now expects either the persisted `wandb_run.json` binding file or a one-time `--wandb-run-id <existing_run_id>` for legacy workdirs.
- Branch này cũng giữ song song bộ notebook TPU `moe1` cho CelebA-HQ: `raes-jax-celebahq-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-s-moe1.ipynb`, `raes-jax-celebahq-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1.ipynb`, và `raes-jax-celebahq-kaggle-tpuv5e8-sitdh-b-moe1-resume.ipynb`, để cùng chung code learned-source nhưng tách workflow dữ liệu/runs theo pipeline HQ.

Current limitation:

- The JAX path intentionally focuses on Stage 2 training/sampling and Stage 1 reconstruction. A dedicated JAX port of the adversarial Stage 1 decoder training loop is not shipped yet, because porting LPIPS + GAN + discriminator into JAX would make the branch substantially larger and harder to maintain.

### Sampling

`src/sample.py` uses the same config schema to draw a small batch of images on a
single device and saves them to `sample.png`:

```bash
python src/sample.py \
  --config <sample_config> \
  --seed 42
```


### Distributed sampling for evaluation

`src/sample_ddp.py` parallelises sampling across TPU cores, producing PNGs and an
FID-ready `.npz`:

```bash
python src/sample_ddp.py \
  --config <sample_config> \
  --sample-dir samples \
  --precision bf16 \
  --label-sampling equal
```
`--label-sampling {equal,random}`: `equal` uses exactly 50 images per class for FID-50k; `random` uniformly samples labels. Using `equal` brings consistently lower FID than `random` by around 0.1. We use `equal` by default.

Autoguidance and classifier-free guidance are controlled via the config’s
`guidance` block.

To compute FID immediately after sampling on the same TPU VM, point `sample_ddp.py`
to reference statistics:

```bash
python src/sample_ddp.py \
  --config <sample_config> \
  --sample-dir samples \
  --precision bf16 \
  --label-sampling equal \
  --fid-ref /path/to/VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz \
  --fid-device cpu
```

This still samples on TPU, but the Inception feature extraction for FID runs on
the host CPU or GPU (`--fid-device auto|cpu|cuda`). You can also set
`--fid-num-threads` to control CPU parallelism explicitly. Rank 0 writes a
`<sample_dir>.fid.json` file with the result.

## Evaluation

### Online evaluation during training (TPU + host CPU/GPU)

The `eval` block above runs held-out validation loss inside `src/train.py` and
sends the resulting scalars to wandb when `--wandb` is enabled. If `fid_ref` is
set, the same block can also trigger periodic FID evaluation. Sampling still
runs on TPU; the Inception feature extraction runs on the host CPU or GPU.

For the JAX adapter, prefer building `fid_ref` with the backend-native detector
so the online FID path and reference statistics use the same Flax Inception
implementation:

```bash
python3 src_jax/build_fid_stats.py \
  --input /path/to/reference_images \
  --output /path/to/reference_stats.pkl \
  --batch-size 64 \
  --num-workers 8
```

On JAX hosts such as Kaggle TPU, keep `--num-workers` modest (`0-8` is usually
enough). The script now switches worker processes to the `spawn` start method
when `num_workers > 0`, which avoids the usual JAX + `fork()` warning.

The JAX adapter accepts either a backend-native `.pkl`/`.pickle` file from
`src_jax/build_fid_stats.py` or an older `.npz` file. When given `.npz`, the
adapter converts it to the backend pickle format on first use.

### Local FID from generated `.npz`

For custom datasets, first build reference statistics once:

```bash
python src/build_fid_stats.py \
  --input /path/to/reference_images \
  --output /path/to/reference_stats.npz \
  --device cpu \
  --num-workers 32 \
  --num-threads 96
```

`--input` accepts either an image folder (recursively scanned) or an existing
`.npy`/`.npz` image archive. This path remains the right choice for the
PyTorch/XLA utilities and for offline `torch-fidelity` scoring. For JAX online
FID, prefer `src_jax/build_fid_stats.py`.

If you already have a generated `.npz`, you can score it directly with:

```bash
python src/evaluate_fid.py \
  --samples /path/to/samples.npz \
  --ref /path/to/VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz \
  --device cpu \
  --num-threads 96 \
  --output-json /path/to/samples.fid.json
```

This path uses `torch-fidelity`'s InceptionV3-compatible feature extractor and
works on CPU or CUDA. It avoids moving samples to another machine, but it is not
the ADM TensorFlow evaluator.

### ADM Suite FID setup (only available on GPU)

Use GPU with the ADM evaluation suite to score generated samples. You need to port the npz file generated from TPU to a GPU machine.

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion.git
   cd guided-diffusion/evaluation
   ```

2. Create an environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   conda create -n adm-fid python=3.10
   conda activate adm-fid
   pip install 'tensorflow[and-cuda]'==2.19 scipy requests tqdm
   ```

3. Download ImageNet statistics (256×256 shown here):

   ```bash
   wget https://openaipublic.blob.core.windows.net/diffusion/jul-2021/ref_batches/imagenet/256/VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz
   ```

4. Evaluate:

   ```bash
   python evaluator.py VIRTUAL_imagenet256_labeled.npz /path/to/samples.npz
   ```
